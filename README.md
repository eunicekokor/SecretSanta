# Secret Santa
### A simple python script to gen Secret Santa Assignments for your group

## To Setup
You need any `.json` file with the fields in `sample_info.json` filled out.
These fields can be changed but need to be reflected in the final `print_to_file`
function.

## To Run
`./secretsanta.py yourjsonfile.json anytextfile.txt`
It will print out paragraphs to your test file you can copy paste in an email.

## Potential Enhancements
- possible email integration
- easier custom fields
- not json input
